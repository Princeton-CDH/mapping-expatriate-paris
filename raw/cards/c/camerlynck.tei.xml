                    s1:
                    	"renewed 6 mos 1 v" likely "1 y," (year)
                    	"70v" likely "70y" (70 per year?)
                    	"60v" likely "60y" (60 per year?)
                    	"English Journey" is rather illegible, arrived at because it is another book by the author of "Angel Pavement" on previous line
                    	First word of "Chanos wheels" could be something else
                    	"Starspangled Mammen" could be "Mammon"--no record of either title in Google
                    s2:
                    	"subce" likely some abbrev. of "subtracted," precise lettering unclear
                    	"Silver Raille" latter word questionable
                   	 	"manaipe" fairly legible, but no idea what word this is
                    	"Lorrie Spirit," first word unclear
                    	"yo v." unclear
                    	"Pelcing Picnic" unclear
                    s3:
                    	text at bottom unclear, "white wuted" (?)
                    		"ordered in Albatross" vs. "ordered w Albatross"
                    s4:
                    	Amount she owes 25 or 26, illegbile [pin] likely currency
                    	Recurrent "v" vs. "y" problem--what abbrev is this?
                    	"Julian Provent," latter word unclear
                    	"Elwyn Heath" unclear, best guess
                    	[mo lv A.] shorthand unclear
                    	"[Eubury] Heath" likely same book as above, still unclear
