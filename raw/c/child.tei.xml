              	 	 Dies in Hospital Here				Feb 10
              	 	Mrs. Bertha Cushing Child, 61-year-
              	 old American musician who has re-
              	 sided in Paris for the past seven years,
              	 died suddenly at the American Hos-
              	 pital at 10.40 a.m. yesterday as the
              	 result of meningitis.  The body will be
              	 cremated tomorrow.  Funeral services,
              	 to be held today, are strictly private.
              	 	Until her retirement several years
              	 ago Mrs. Child was well known in
              	 musical circles in America as a con-
              	 tralto.  She sang with the Boston
              	 Symphony Orchestra and other out-
              	 standing organizations.  Since coming
              	 to France she had been living at 7
              	 rue Servandoni.  She is survived by 
              	 two sons and one daughter.  The
              	 latter, Meeda Munro, is Paris corres-
              	 pondent for "Town and Country."  One
              	 son, Charles Child, is en route to
              	 France on the Leviathan, following
              	 a cable from his sister yesterday.  An-
              	 other son, Paul, is in America.
